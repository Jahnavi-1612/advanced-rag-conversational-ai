End-to-end RAG-based Conversational AI using LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace, Groq, and Streamlit for real-time semantic search and knowledge retrieval.
# Advanced RAG-Based Conversational AI System 

## Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for building a **context-aware conversational AI system**. Unlike regular chatbots, this system retrieves relevant knowledge from a database before generating responses, ensuring **accurate and contextually relevant answers**.

It leverages:
- **LangChain** for orchestrating language model pipelines,
- **FAISS** for high-speed semantic search over embeddings,
- **Groq LLM** for optimized inference,
- **HuggingFace Transformers** for natural language understanding and generation.

This system is ideal for **customer support, knowledge retrieval, AI assistants, and industrial applications**.

##  Key Features

- **Context-Aware Responses:** Combines retrieved knowledge with user queries to generate accurate answers.
- **Semantic Search:** Embeddings-based retrieval for fast and relevant information lookup.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Interactive web app for real-time conversation.
- **Optimized Inference:** Uses Groq hardware acceleration for fast model responses.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new documents or knowledge sources to improve performance.

##  Project Architecture

The system works in **three main steps**:

1. **Ingestion & Embedding:**  
   - Knowledge documents (text, PDF, CSV) are converted into **vector embeddings** using HuggingFace models.  
   - Embeddings are stored in **FAISS** for fast retrieval.

2. **Query & Retrieval:**  
   - User queries are converted into embeddings.  
   - FAISS finds the most semantically similar knowledge snippets.

3. **Generation:**  
   - Retrieved snippets are passed to **Groq LLM**.  
   - The model generates a **context-aware, coherent response**.
